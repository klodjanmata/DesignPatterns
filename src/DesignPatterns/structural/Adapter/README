Scenario:

Suppose you have a MediaPlayer interface that can play audio files,
but you need to integrate a VideoPlayer that can play video files as well.
The VideoPlayer does not conform to the MediaPlayer interface.
The Adapter pattern can help bridge this gap.

Explanation:

    MediaPlayer Interface:
        MediaPlayer defines the interface for playing media files.

    AudioPlayer Class:
        AudioPlayer implements MediaPlayer and can play mp3 files directly.
        For other formats (vlc and mp4), it uses MediaAdapter.

    AdvancedMediaPlayer Interface:
        AdvancedMediaPlayer defines the interface for playing advanced media files like vlc and mp4.

    Concrete AdvancedMediaPlayer Classes:
        VlcPlayer and Mp4Player implement AdvancedMediaPlayer.

    MediaAdapter Class:
        MediaAdapter implements MediaPlayer and uses AdvancedMediaPlayer to play vlc and mp4 files.

    AdapterPatternDemo Class:
        Demonstrates the usage of AudioPlayer to play different media formats.
        The AudioPlayer uses MediaAdapter to play formats other than mp3.

This example demonstrates how the Adapter pattern allows AudioPlayer
to play different formats (mp4 and vlc) by using the MediaAdapter to bridge the gap between
MediaPlayer and AdvancedMediaPlayer.
